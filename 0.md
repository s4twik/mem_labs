only thing relvant which can be looked in to is CMD prompt so use cmdscan to what's was going on there

finds a file being run who's output is `335d366f5d6031767631707f`
looks like hex will look into it

some gibberish~

now i am kinda clueless so i try the commands i know randomly i don't find anything so i refer to the writeup, i have got things right till here i find out!

apparently enviornment is a hint to enviornment variable so i use `envars` 
to find a variable called `Thanos` which is mentioned in the question and it's values are `xor and password`
after the xor decode on the gibberish provided on dcode we get this ` 1_4m_b3tt3r}`


`hasdump`

 so we get the hash from there and after NTLM cracking (i didn't find any website but it's given in the wirteup )
flag{you_are_good_but

we get the flag flag{you_are_good_but_1_4m_b3tt3r}
